////////////////////////// errors and problem in code

1) WrappedListComponent.propTypes = {
items: PropTypes.array(PropTypes.shapeOf({
 text: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
 })),
};
In this Proptypes.array(Proptypes.shapeof() is creating the error.

2)
Second error I have faced that is we are using maps on items so it becomes 
necessary to check that map is not empty.

3)
Third and last problem I found in this is -> 
const [setSelectedIndex, selectedIndex] = useState();
this was original code =>
here the setter and state are replaced the general format to declare a state is like 
this =>
const[stateValue, stateValueSetter] = useState(initial value);
But in original code setter is written before and state later thatâ€™s why it caused 
error.
